### refer history prompt
- I am a website development beginner, therefore the attachment requirement is too large to be developed. Therefore, I want to split it into more small sub-systems for on-job self-training. Please split the attachment into sub-systems which can be developed and run stand alone. Therefore, each sub-system need to have their own PRD document which include features, system architecture, Technology Stack Table, MVP, block diagram, flow chart and time sequence chart.
The names of sub-system are listed as following (but not limited, may have different name):
1.	Authentification
2.	I18N (multi-language)
3.	Create group and Chat
4.	Banking integration
5.	Fund management
6.	Drizzle ORM
7.	Calendar
8.	Income and expenditure booking. 
9.	Dark/light mode
10.	Drag & drop rearrangement
11.	QR Invite Auto-Fill
12.	income and expenditure categorization
13.	Multi-Currency & Exchange Management
14.	Pricing & Subscription
15.	Customer feedback

Every subsystem may start with each subsystem’s MVP and then expend from MVP to the whole subsystem. Please also suggest the priority.

### Prompt
- please use attached bmad method po.md and sm.md and clinic_PRD0904.md and Clinext_architecture0904.md to create clinext_subsystem_dev_plan.md subsystem development plan.  Each subsystem can be developed, loop-tested and run stand alone.  Every subsystem may start with each subsystem’s MVP and then expand from MVP to the whole subsystem and integrated to a whole system.
- Please list out all sub-systems and their features.
